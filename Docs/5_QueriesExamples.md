# Filtering/Searching

# Linguistic assignment

# Fuzzy join using linguistic assignment

# Fuzzy join using intersection of triangles

# Fuzzy grouping using linguistic assignment

# Finding the membership degree of specific linguistic value

# State detection using KSQL only

# Plans for improvements

* Implementation of the state detection done on Kafka Streams API instead of KSQL only
* Changing all bruteforce/high resource usage (not optimal complexities) to more efficient approaches
